<p>Want to lose weight, get fit, and start mindful eating? Our fasting tracker is here to help, with daily fasting plans and diets, health tips, and weight-loss motivation!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Why intermittent fasting?</h2>
<p>Weight loss is the most common reason people try starvation diets. If you eat fewer meals, your body gets fewer calories — that’s why fasting is so effective.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting involves alternating from controlled periods of eating to avoiding food. This way, your glycogen levels deplete and your body enters ketosis — also known as the body’s “fat-burning” mode.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Additionally, interval fasting:</h2>
<p>- Helps you lose weight
- Controls blood insulin and sugar levels
- Stimulates metabolism
- Reduces inflammation — detox mode</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Can I use the intermittent fasting app for weight loss?</h2>
<p>Yes! The app offers daily fasting plans suitable for men and women.
Choose from the most popular plans — 14:10, 18:6, or 16:8 — when you start fasting. 
Advanced users can try the 21:3 or even the OMAD (one meal a day) schedule.</p>
<p>If you choose the 16:8 fasting diet, you’ll be able to eat during an 8-hour window, and then you’ll avoid eating for the remaining 16 hours.</p>
<p>Simply use the fasting timer and stay hydrated. You can easily customize your eating schedule or choose from any of the daily fasting plans and diet. Reach your healthy weight goals no matter what diet you follow — from keto to low carb or intuitive eating!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Features of the fasting app:</h2>
<p>- Different fasting plans
<span>- </span>Monitor your weight and water intake
<span>- </span>Eating & fasting tracker
- Easy to use fasting timer — one tap to start/end
- Step counter and 7-min workouts
- Fasting guide & insights on nutrition and health

com.ketodietapp.ketodiet.full,KetoDiet: Keto Diet App Tracke,"KetoDiet App the original low-carb app from KetoDietApp.com

Keto Diet is not just about losing weight at any cost; it's about adopting a healthier lifestyle. Apart from reducing your carbohydrate intake, you will learn why it’s important to follow a whole foods based approach and include healthy fat sources like olive oil, fatty fish and pastured meat in your everyday diet.

A healthy low-carb diet is an effective weight loss tool as it will keep your blood sugar level stable and your appetite under control. Apart from fat burning effects, a low-carbohydrate lifestyle can additionally improve health conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and inflammation, all of which increase the risk of developing heart disease.

The ketogenic diet appears to be useful adjuvant to treatment for health conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type 2 Diabetes, epilepsy and even some types of cancer.

<u>How is Keto Diet better than other apps?</u>

• Free content added daily including recipes, articles, expert advice and more.
• Accuracy is crucial for a low-carb diet. For that reason, we don't crowdsource nutritional data. All nutritional data in Keto Diet are based on accurate, verifiable sources, rather than user-generated contributions or other unreliable sources.
• We keep your data private - Keto Diet never sells or shares your data in any way.

<u>More than just an app!</u>

KetoDietApp.com is one the top low-carb websites. More than two million people visit us every month.

• Thousands have already joined our Keto Diet Challenges to stay motivated while following a healthy low carb diet
• Facebook support group to help you get started and answer any questions you may have

<u>What is Keto?</u>

When you follow a ketogenic diet by reducing your carb intake to less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body will start producing ketones in the liver. You will enter ketosis and start using fat and ketone bodies as energy source. One of the main benefits of ketosis is its ability to suppress appetite. While your ketone levels will increase, your blood glucose levels and insulin levels will drop, leading to satiety. You will naturally eat less and the number of calories eaten will drop.

dumbbell.workout.challenge.home,Dumbbell Workout at Home,"This 30-day dumbbell challenge works every muscle in your body.
When it comes to strength-training equipment, dumbbells reign supreme. They're more compact than barbells, easier to hold than kettlebells and better for progressing your workouts than resistance bands. Plus, you can add one or two to just about any exercise.

We put together the best home dumbbell workout for beginners, to prove the versatility of dumbbells. We created the perfect full-body program that will help you decide how to pick the correct weight, master proper form for common exercises and build strength in all your major muscle groups. 

<b>Best home dumbbell workout challenge for beginners.</b>
Getting a new body doesn’t have to be complicated, nor do you necessarily need the gym, which is handy. Whether you’re aiming for rapid fat loss, build muscles or cardiovascular fitness, a pair of dumbbells will tick the box – providing you use them correctly.

This total body home workout is perfect for working the entire body. All you need are a few sets of dumbbells and these basic exercises. All of these moves will hit the major muscles of your body, including the chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs, and abs in a short period of time. It includes all the classic exercises and can be done in a short period of time. This is a great workout option when you are crunched for time, but still want to get the job done. 

Not only is weightlifting fun, it's one of the best ways to lower your body fat percentage and build lean muscle. If you're a beginner, you're probably wondering what weightlifting exercises you should be doing at the gym, and I'm glad you're thinking one step ahead. Most trainers agree that compound exercises — moves that work multiple muscle groups at once — like squats and pull-ups, elicit a greater energy expenditure and enable the body to burn more calories and body fat.

Easy full body workout: these are the best home dumbbell exercises for beginners.
This plan primarily uses exercises that work multiple muscle groups instead of one at a time. When you only have 30 days to make a change, you need to be efficient with your time. This best home dumbbell workout for beginners will work almost every muscle in your body for a guaranteed burn.",32885,0,0,0,1,0,1,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,16,0,1,1,"Jul 31, 2020",0.833333333,3.5

IS IT EFFECTIVE?

Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.

CAN I USE FASTING TRACKER?
With various fasting plans, fasting tracker is suitable for <b>beginner and experienced, men and women</b>. It guides you through your plan. No need to change your diet, you can easily stick to it.

Detox
Your body reduces inflammation. Cells break down viruses, bacteria and damaged components.

Prevent Diseases
Studies show that fasting can prevent numerous diseases, such as heart diseases, diabetes and cancer.

Cell Repair and Regenerate

Control Blood Sugar

Increase Metabolism

In addition, you can create groups for different events, create multiple lists per group and invite multiple members. E.g. for family, roommates, office, wedding, vacation, party planning, etc.
 
To briefly clarify, each group has its own <b>chat with picture and text messages</b>. Helpful if you don't know which shampoo to buy? Or who will bring the barbecue charcoal after Max has cancelled at short notice? 

With the group chat you can rely on the fact that the messages are sent to all group members. You don't have to create a group in WhatsApp first. Or worry about whether everyone is on WhatsApp? Or Facebook Messenger, Telegram or Viber.

• Select items from the master list and add them with one click.
• Create a shopping list of items you buy regularly, select all items with one click and add them to the preferred list.

Display shopping lists either <b>categorized, alphabetically sorted or manually sorted</b> (see picture #4). Each shopping list can have its own sorting.

In the supermarket you <b>do not</b> have to scroll the list, because if you sort the items into categories and set the category order for the supermarket, the items will appear one after the other as you go through the supermarket. Crossed-off items and whole categories are placed at the end of the list (see picture #5).

Create <b>recipes</b> with ingredients, directions and pictures. With a few clicks you can add all ingredients to a shopping list (see picture #6).

Add <b>pictures to items</b> to always buy the right shampoo, cat food or coffee.

All you have to do is to get the pointer to green by the end of the day. Calorie Meter gives you real-time guidance on the number of calories you have to eat or burn at any point of time during the day to move to green. For best results, follow your capsule with precision diet tracker and smart workout trainer.

What is intermittent fasting?
Intermittent fasting (IF) is a meal timing schedule that switches between periods of eating and fasting. It is an easy and safe way to lose belly fat and live a healthy life. During IF, your body can enter ketosis, which enables your body to burn fat. When you are in your fasting window, you'd better eat food with zero calories. During the eating window, you don't need a calorie counter, meal plan, or food tracker anymore. There are many fasting benefits, such as slowing down the aging process and helping you lose weight.

There are many types of fasting diet plans for beginners and experienced men and women. The most common intermittent fasting schedules or methods are 16:8, 5:2, and water fasting. If you choose the 16-hour fasting intervals, you will fast for 16 hours. 

Common IF plans:
Gentle – 14:10
Extended – 16:8 
Extreme – 18:6, 20:4, OMAD (one meal a day), alternate-day fasting

WHAT IS BLUE LIGHT?
Blue light is the visible light spectrum (380-550nm) for circadian regulation. It contains more energy than other visible light types, so it may damage your retinal cells.

WHY SHOULD I USE BLUE LIGHT FILTER?
<b>Research shows</b> that exposure to blue light imposes serious threats to retinal neurons, causes eye strain, dry eyes, and inhibits the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. With our night shift function, your vision health will be greatly improved.

CAN BLUE LIGHT FILTER IMPROVE MY SLEEP?
Yes. Natural exposure to blue light during the daylight hours boosts people's energy, alertness and mood; however, it will disturb your sleep at night.(from wiki) Blue light filter can effectively reduce blue light from the screen and help you get better sleep.

BENEFITS OF IYENGAR YOGA

Improves Posture: With minor adjustments to improve alignment through Iyengar Yoga, small muscles that are often ignored become stronger and as a result, enable you to sit and stand straighter, giving you more energy, less pain, and increased confidence.

Increases Flexibility: The use of easily available props such as tables, chairs, wooden blocks, straps, etc. in Iyengar Yoga enables practitioners, whether beginners or advanced, to hold correct postures when performing yoga asanas.

Improves Breathing: While precise alignment is key in every yoga asana, focused and controlled breathing is also of equal importance when practicing Iyengar Yoga. The more you practice breathing through Iyengar Yoga, the less you’ll end up holding your breath in times of stress, allowing a constant flow of oxygen to the brain.

Tones Muscles: Since Iyengar Yoga exercises every muscle, the result is a full body toning experience and a refinement in your awareness to the deeper workings of your muscles within your body.

Calms Mind: Iyengar Yoga encourages you to focus on the precise alignment of your body by disengaging other thoughts. Thereby, allowing you to be fully present in the moment and inculcating a habit to calm your mind on and off the mat",11681,0,0,0,1,0,1,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,6,0,0,0,"Apr 9, 2022",0.909090909,3.727272727

com.fitonomy.health.fitness,Fitonomy: Home Workout Tracker,"It was a typical Wednesday evening when Marie decided to try out a new fitness app that promised to help her tone and sculpt her body. She had always been hesitant to commit to a workout routine, but she was feeling especially motivated after a friend recommended the Fitonomy App and its AI personal trainer.
Marie was a little nervous as she signed up for the 28 day challenge and began her first home workout. She wasn't sure if she would be able to keep up with the daily exercises, but she was determined to give it her all.
Over the next few weeks, Marie followed her personalized workout schedule and tracked her progress with the app's workout tracker and exercise tracker. She was amazed at how easy it was to work out at home and how much she enjoyed it. She even set up a small home gym with some basic equipment to make it even easier to stay on track.
As she continued with the daily workouts, Marie noticed that she was getting stronger and more toned. She especially loved the butt workouts and was thrilled to see the progress she was making in that area.
By the end of the 28 day challenge, Marie was feeling confident and proud of herself. She had completed every single workout and had even signed up for the app's 30 day fitness challenge. She was amazed at how much her body had changed in such a short amount of time and couldn't believe that she had found a workout routine that she actually enjoyed.
Marie knew that she couldn't have done it without the support of Fitonomy and the app's AI workout trainer and the structure of the fitness challenges. She was grateful to have found a program that fit her busy schedule and allowed her to exercise at home. She even started to recommend the app to her friends and family, encouraging them to join her on her fitness journey.
As she continued on her fitness journey, Marie knew that she had found a sustainable way to stay in shape and feel her best. She was grateful to have found a program that offered daily workouts and a personal trainer, and she knew that she would be able to achieve her goals with their help. <h3><b>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS</b></h3> Fitonomy is free to download.

paleo.diet.app,Paleo diet app: Diet tracker,"Have you ever wanted to eat a healthy meal but felt like your plans never worked? Or are you worried that you are just gaining weight? Has your food diet plan never shown glimpses of success? Don’t worry! We have the perfect feast for you. Get healthy and dietary recipes with our paleo diet app.  

What is a paleo diet plan and how is it different from other diet plans?
It can also be called Paleolithic nutrition or caveman diet. It mimics the meals and eating habits of our ancestors. It means to eat a lot of plants, protein-rich meat, fish and egg, liquids like water, soup, and herbal tea. Keep in mind that the paleo diet means it is automatically gluten-free as well. Foods with fat, sugar, and dairy should be avoided. 

People following a paleo diet can also adhere to the Mediterranean and dash diet structure. Mediterranean-style eating stresses fruits and vegetables, legumes, and whole grains and allows wine in moderation. When comparing the caveman diet with the Mediterranean diet, paleo doesn’t encourage the consumption of grains, dairy, and processed sugar. But the Mediterranean diet emphasizes whole grains and dairy products with a limit on animal protein. Another diet plan is called dash, which follows a similar pattern of diet and helps lose weight.

What’s in our paleo recipe app?
Our cookbook has several easy-to-cook recipes that adhere to the caveman feast. There are step-by-step preparation details for each paleo recipe. We also have a diet tracker and calorie counter to keep track of your keto diets. The count of calories will be generated by the paleo diet calculator at the end of each week. 

Some healthy recipes in the app would include soup, paella, and dishes made from kale and other proteins that help in muscle building and detox. Nowadays, there are a lot of restaurants coming up with simple paleo diet recipes.

The app also has engaging picture recipes to keep it interesting. Healthy diets help you while fasting and keep you fit. The keto tracker is a good coach in your weight loss journey. The paleo diet app also has a liquid tracker to check your fluid consumption.

How does it benefit you?
The dieting plan provided by the paleo recipes app will help you in your weight loss process. The paleo keto recipes help you enjoy a great feast and also keep a check on your health. The Paleo diet prevents ketosis. Ketosis happens when your body burns stored fat for energy instead of blood sugar. Our cookbook has recipes from all around the globe. Following the caveman dieting planner, will make you have a low risk of heart diseases and is anti-inflammatory, and helps in weight loss. The inbuilt tracker will monitor your progress and give you the necessary alerts.

Follow our paleo keto diet, and let us be a part of your healthy lifestyle!",8927,4.125,3,0,1,0,1,FOOD_AND_DRINK,4,0,1,1,"Feb 27, 2020",0.95,4.55

com.eyefilter.nightmode.bluelightfilter,Blue Light Filter - Night Mode,"Eyes feel tired during night reading on the phone?  

Have trouble in sleeping after long time watching phone screen?

That is due to blue light. Blue light from your phone and tablet screen is the visible light spectrum (380-550nm) for circadian regulation. According to the <b>scientific studies</b>, exposure to blue light imposes serious threats to retinal neurons and inhibits the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. It is <b>proven</b> that reducing blue light can greatly improve sleep.

Blue light filter is used to reduce blue light by adjusting the screen to natural color. Shifting your screen to night mode can relieve your eyes strain, and your eyes will feel at ease during <b>night reading</b>. Also blue light filter will <b>protect your eyes</b> and help you <b>sleep easily</b>.

Features:
● Reduce blue light 
● Adjustable filter intensity
● Save power
● Very easy to use

com.rhythmic_breathing.app,Rhythmic Breathing. Meditation,"<b>The way we breathe determines the way we live.</b>

Relaxed, harmonious breathing signifies health, calmness, a steady pace of life, and high stress resistance.

<b>That's meditation, in which the body breathes in step with the mind.</b>

Our breathing depends on our own state of mind and changes along with it. It can therefore vary between being energetic and elevated when we're excited, frequent and shallow when we're stressed, or free, even, and smooth when we're calm and relaxed. 

<b>By controlling our breathing, we can manage our own well-being, calm our emotions, and improve our health.</b>

Deep, relaxed breathing improves the exchange of gases in our lungs, affects the functioning of all internal organs, and reduces stress. We become calmer, more relaxed, and thus more successful.
Our quality of life improves, we have more energy and strength, and our health improves.

<b>In this app you'll find:</b>

✦ training for how to breathe in a relaxing way
✦ rhythms that are suggested by Yantra yoga, the Tibetan yoga of breath
✦ statistics of your activities
✦ personal training settings
✦ interesting information about breathing

At the core of the system of rhythmic breathing lies ancient Tibetan knowledge about breathing. Nowadays, this knowledge can be found in Yantra yoga, a Tibetan yoga of movement. This training is one of Yantra yoga's pranayamas. The precise rhythm and how to properly develop it were described many centuries ago and have survived undistorted to this day.

The training involves following the four phases of breathing: the in-breath, holding one's breath at the end of the in-breath, the out-breath, and holding one's breath without any air (when the lungs are empty). If you follow these phases in a specific rhythm, your breathing will become peaceful, your mind will relax, and your emotions will become harmonious.",62595,4.590909,8,0,1,0,0,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,7,0,0,0,"Nov 17, 2018",0.836734694,4.857142857

com.gymnext.timer,Flex Timer,"Say hello to the future of interval training timers!

The GymNext Flex Timer is the world's first interval training timer app that also controls a wall mounted LED display.  It's great for interval training workouts like CrossFit, HIIT, Bootcamps, Intensity, MMA, boxing, and many others.

While traditional wall-mounted LED timers provide a great, easy to see display, they are plagued by difficult to use remotes that are easily broken or lost.  Alternatively, smartphone timer apps provide a much simpler, more powerful approach to control and setup, but the in-app display is difficult to see from around the gym.  

Enter the Flex Timer - the best of both worlds!  Combining a highly visible LED display that can be seen from all over your gym with the most advanced, easiest to use interval timer app available.  You're going to love it!

Check out these great features:
* use the app standalone without an LED display or combine it with our Home or Gym Edition timers and you'll never squint to see the time remaining again
* eight highly customizable timer modes including Standard, Round, Interval, Tabata, EMOM, Stopwatch, Shot Clock and Beep Test to cover virtually any workout you can think of
* save your favorite workouts for instant recall in the future
* go hands-free with Android Gear or Pebble to control the timer from your wrist
* hook up your bluetooth heart rate monitor and you can track your heart rate as you workout or setup zones to let you know whether your pace is appropriate
* connect to multiple clocks around your gym and simultaneously control all of them or hook up to them individually and run separate classes
* run multiple different timer at the same time
* with bluetooth control, you can now start, stop and pause your timer from acute angles and around corners - no more line of sight restrictions

High Praise for the GymNext Flex Timer:

""This will eventually become the standard for all gyms""
- Garage Gym Reviews

""All our coaches love the clock""
- CrossFit Barrie

""We got the Gym Edition and we love it to death""
- Wolverine Strength & Conditioning

healthyspine.backexercises.improveposture,Improve Posture For A Healthy ,"The Guide to Perfect Posture in 30 Days.

Good posture involves training your body to stand, walk, sit and lie in positions where the least strain is placed on supporting muscles and ligaments during movement or weight-bearing activities. This app provides illustrations and instructions with exercises for a correct posture.

Luckily there are many things we can do to help improve our spine health including maintaining good general fitness and a healthy weight, as well as paying attention to our posture throughout the day.  

Want the lean look and elegant stance of a yoga or pilates teacher? It all starts with good posture.
The best way to improve your posture is to focus on exercises that strengthen your core -- the abdominal and low back muscles that connect to your spine and pelvis. Some of these muscles move your torso by flexing, extending, or rotating your spine. Others stabilize your pelvis and spine in a natural, neutral position.

Make these posture-boosting exercises a regular part of your routine. Remember to exhale strongly and pull in your core muscles as you work -- a key principle in both pilates and yoga.

Getting that perfect spine back isn’t going to be a quick fix. You’ll need consistency, awareness, and dedication. 

Having good posture is about more than looking good. It helps you to develop strength, flexibility, and balance in your body. These can all lead to less muscle pain and more energy throughout the day. Proper posture also reduces stress on your muscles and ligaments, which can reduce your risk of injury.

Improving your posture also helps you become more aware of your muscles, making it easier to correct your own posture. As you work on your posture and become more aware of your body, you might even notice some imbalances or areas of tightness you weren’t previously aware of.

Over the next 30 days, our movements and exercises will help you:
- loosen up muscles
- increase body awareness
- strengthen your core
- realign your body’s joints",22268,0,0,0,1,0,1,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,16,0,1,1,"Mar 8, 2019",0.4,1.8

<b>What Our Users Are Saying</b>
• ""This app is absolutely brilliant. It's a very simple no fuss gym tracker. It has all these small features that I keep discovering that keeps me thinking how well it's built. The main features I am extremely thankful for are the ""View last time"" feature per exercise that you can go back in the history quickly and the small little ""Easy, med and hard"" color tags you can tag each set with. There are a bunch of others that the dev did right, thanks so much. I can see there's a lot of thought that went into this and it wasn't just built to build an app! Well done!"" - Bernhard Smuts
• ""This app is phenomenal. The design descions and features are all super intuitive and cater to weightlifting perfectly. One of my favourite things is the way the app handles adding exercises and sets. You can add sets from a preset workout or one by one, and adding custom exercises is a breeze. Every time you add an exercise it prepopulates the sets from your last exercise and there is a quick look button that shows how heavy you went last time you did the exercise. I cannot recommend it enough."" - Sam Mete
• ""I was about to lose my mind trying to find an intuitive, straightforward app to track my workouts. I finally stopped the search with this app. It didn't take long to add previous workouts, and it's so convenient for logging new workouts as well."" - Tara Gordon

com.samantharoobol.jumprope,Jump Rope Workout Program,"If you're looking to push your calorie burning, fat-busting HIIT workouts to the next level, you should start skipping.

Not days in the gym, of course. Just skip out on the weights in favor of one of the most efficient pieces of equipment you probably laying around: the jump rope.

<b>Jump Rope HIIT Workout Routines to Burn Fat and Train Cardio</b>
At-home cardio workouts can be easier than you think—especially if you have a jump rope. A jump rope workout can be a fun and challenging way to get in your cardio when you have to stay in one place. Jumping rope can help maximize your workout, even if you only have a few minutes. It seriously challenges the cardiovascular system while also helping to improve coordination and muscle strength.

Can't muster the motivation to make it to the gym? Skip it! Jumping rope burns more than 10 calories a minute while strengthening your legs, butt, shoulders, and arms. And it doesn't take long to reap great rewards. You can burn more than 200 calories in two 10-minute sessions each day (yep... that's 1000 calories a week).

Jumping rope (also referred to as rope skipping) is a staple in a boxer's conditioning program. 
Jumping rope is also a great way to fit in an effective cardio session when you're on the go—just toss your jump rope in your carry-on! You'll probably feel completely energized after jumping rope too.

Try adding our workout routines to your existing strength plan, or do it alone as a cardio workout. Add a jump rope to high intensity interval training (HIIT), and you're in for a hell of a workout. Jumping rope is a great way to burn off those extra calories while getting in a full body workout. 

<b>Jump Rope Weight Loss Routine - Home Cardio HIIT Program</b>
One of the best methods to get in a fast, efficient workout is to use jump rope for your HIIT endurance routine. And while running is a popular choice when it comes to HIIT workouts, there are several reasons to pick up a jump rope instead.

What are you waiting for? Hop to it!

com.samantharoobol.weighttrainingwomen,Weight Training for Women,"Weight lifting isn't just for men. It's a myth that lifting weights will make women bulky or put them at risk of injury. Women can excel at weight lifting and experience major physical and mental benefits from strength training, including a leaner, more muscular body as well as better self-esteem.

Our workout programs are designed to get you leaner and stronger with minimal cardio and a lot of picking up and putting down heavy stuff – otherwise known as strength training. If you're looking to lose weight or just maintain your physique, try cutting back on cardio for a few weeks to focus on these strength training exercises for women that increase metabolism and build lean muscle.

We don’t mean bodyweight strength training. We mean building up to use dumbbells, a barbell, free weights, and kettlebells. That’s right, I’m talking about dominating that section of the gym. Strength training is one of the most rewarding skills one can master with just a few simple and extremely functional movements. 

Lifting weights two to three times per week is extremely beneficial for women to reduce their risk of osteoporosis by promoting bone health. Between the ages of 30 and 70, muscle mass and strength decrease by an average of 30%, mostly due to inactivity. Weight training can prevent or even reverse this process and, in turn, provides the following benefits: improved performance of physical activities, prevention and management of chronic diseases, improved joint health, prevention and treatment of low-back pain, injury prevention, relief of aches and pains from stress or after prolonged sitting, improved posture, and improved quality of sleep.

<b>How to Start Lifting Weights: A Beginner's Guide</b>
Whether your goal is to build muscle mass or achieve a fitter, more toned body, weight training can help you get there. Weight training, also known as resistance or strength training, builds lean, stronger muscles, strengthens your bones and joints, and even helps boost your metabolism. This means you’ll burn more calories even when you’re resting.

Stronger muscles can also improve your athletic performance and reduce your chance of injuries. Even if you’ve never done any kind of weight training before, it’s never too late to start. Strength training is appropriate for both men and women, and it can be started at any age or fitness level.

You don’t need to be a fitness buff. In fact, you don’t even need to belong to a gym. You can simply use your body weight for many exercises or use free weights, dumbbells, barbell, resistance bands, or other home fitness equipment to get results.

This app will walk you through how to get started with weight training and provide suggested exercises and training advice (plus 30 day programs!) for beginners.",85179,3.7142856,3,0,1,0,1,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,14,0,1,1,"Jul 13, 2021",0.5,3.8

prox.lab.calclock,Sectograph. Day & Time planner,"<b>Sectograph</b> is a <i>time planner</i> that visually displays a list of tasks and events for the day in the form of a <i>12-hour pie chart</i> - a watch dial.
The application will help you <u>sharpen your sense of time</u> and <u>allow you to visualize your day</u>.

<b>HOW IT WORKS</b>

In short, it is a projection of your routine and tasks onto the clock face. It visualizes your day for precise timekeeping and offers you peace of mind.
The scheduler works like an analog clock face. It automatically fetches all the events from your Google calendar (or local calendar) and places them on a 12-hour sectored watch face. This technology can be called a ""Calendar clock"".

<b>HOW IT LOOKS</b>

The list of your calendar events is projected in the form of a pie chart in the application and on the home screen widget.
Events are sectors, the beginning and duration of which you can clearly track using special arcs to follow your plan.
A calendar and analog clock combined gives you an amazingly visual representation of your work, allowing you to effectively plan and calculate your day.

<b>WHAT CAN THE APPLICATION BE USED FOR?</b>

✔ Daily scheduling and visual timing. Track your daily tasks, agendas, appointments, and events in Sectograph, and at any time, find out how much time is left until the end of the current event and the start of the next one. Don't be late.
✔ Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in the docking station at your workstation and your office day plan is under control.
✔ Schedule of classes. Keep your phone close at hand and see how much time is left until the end of those tiring lectures – and never be late for lab work again.
✔ Self-organization at home. Your daily routine is now more convenient than ever. Remember to balance work, rest and physical activity, just use the app as an organizer for your home routine.
✔ Trip timer and flight duration. Do you lose track of time due to endless travel and flights? Visually control your check-in, landing and flight duration. Keep everything under control.
✔ Follow your meal schedule, medication schedule, exercise therapy, and other important activities. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!
✔ Convenient countdown of any lengthy scheduled events. Don't miss the end of your vacation and know exactly how many days are left until the end of your military service.
✔ Monitor everyday affairs on the go and in your car. Achieve your goals by keeping the application installed on the device.
✔ Time management using GTD technology. Is planning your day confusing? With the function of striking out or hiding flagged events, keep your chart as clean as possible. Sectograph will improve your time management.
✔ My goals. The app can be used to achieve goals from your Google calendar. It will help you with timekeeping, organize your day, and assist you in completing your goals on time.
✔ Attention-deficit. According to our users, the application is effective for attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD). If you are wasting time and have trouble concentrating on tasks, this app may be useful to you.
✔ The application will be useful for fans of the ""Chronodex"" concept. You can use the Sectograph as an analog of a paper diary used by this concept.
✔ Display doings from Microsoft Outlook calendar. (beta)

com.WahooFitness.SYSTM,Wahoo SYSTM,"Wahoo SYSTM is the most comprehensive, immersive and effective training app available for time-crunched cyclists, triathletes, and other endurance athletes. Backed by cutting-edge sports science, SYSTM takes the guesswork out of training with personalized cycling, triathlon and running workouts; strength training, yoga, and mental training, all integrated into easy-to-follow training plans for every discipline.

SYSTM puts you in the middle of the action with a huge library of workouts paired to heart-pumping, motivating content. Experience what it’s like to be a professional cyclist with the ‘ProRide’ series, featuring first-person, on-board camera footage from the biggest races in the world. Train alongside Wahoo athletes and get a backstage pass to getting fast with the ‘A Week With’ series, go ‘On Location’ to ride the world's most iconic routes, push yourself with a workout from ‘The Sufferfest’ collection, or get inspired with the Inspiration series of cycling-focused documentaries paired to base and recovery sessions. You can even join your favorite Global Cycling Network presenters in the studio for a guided GCN Training session that mimics an indoor cycling class. And if you want to stream your own content while doing a structured workout, fire up one of the SYSTM NoVid sessions.

SYSTM works with most Bluetooth-enabled trainers and fitness devices so you can train to personalized power, heart rate and cadence targets.
Other training apps set power targets based on a simple percentage of your sustained power (FTP). SYSTM uses a comprehensive 4DP® fitness test to calculate your Rider Type, identify your strengths and weaknesses, and measure what you’re capable of across 4 critical performance metrics: Neuromuscular Power (sprint power), Anaerobic Capacity (1-minute power), Maximal Aerobic Power (5-minute power), and FTP (20-minute power). Using 4DP®, SYSTM then tailors the power targets in your workouts so you get the most out of the time you have to train. You’ll work at the exact intensity necessary to get stronger and faster, without wasting a single pedal stroke.

Use the SYSTM Training Plan Builder to configure your own easy-to-follow, comprehensive training plan for road, multisport, cyclocross, gravel, mountain biking, and eSports. Add yoga, strength training, and mental training to your plan for truly complete training. Every training plan is tailored to your fitness level and designed to deliver maximum gains with minimum time. Grounded in cutting-edge sports science and proven by victories in the most prestigious events in the world, SYSTM training plans deliver results.

app.endive,Endive - IBS Food Diary & Symp,"Simply track what you eat, your symptoms and moods and Endive will help you identify correlations in a visual graph form.

Food is a common trigger of digestive symptoms. Avoiding certain foods or keeping a low FODMAP diet can dramatically improve issues like gas, bloating, stomach pain, diarrhoea, constipation and others.

However, everyone is different and there is no one-size-fits-all IBS diet: Keeping a diary of what you eat and how you feel is vital to learning what triggers your symptoms.

Take charge of your digestion and gut health.

📉PERSONALISED TRACKER 
Add custom foods and symptoms that are personal to you and track them together with the others. Endive knows recipes and breaks them down into ingredients to make IBS tracking faster and more efficient.

If you have a condition you know about, but want to optimise your diet to help improve your symptoms, Endive helps you keep track of what you have eaten and how you feel, both physically and psychologically. This allows you to learn how your body reacts to different foods 🥑, or which triggers (e.g. anxiety, depression) are causing you symptoms.

📊WIDE RANGING TRACKER

Endive helps you manage conditions such as:

✅ IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome)
✅ IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)
✅ Food intolerance and sensitivities (such as Dairy, Wheat/Gluten, Lactose)
✅ Acid reflux

✅ Coeliac disease
✅ SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth)

com.samantharoobol.fullbody,Full Body Workout Routine,"The full-body workout is simple in concept–you train your entire body in one workout.

<b>Our Full Body workout routine is a total body training for beginners at home.</b>
In a full-body routine, you train every major muscle in your body, like your chest, back, arms, hamstrings, and abs, in each workout.
Full Body workouts are the best training programs for women and men.
They incorporate exercises that engage many of those muscle groups in one movement, like squats, deadlifts, and overhead presses, all of which are also called compound movements. Compound movements demand a lot of energy and burn more calories, but they also beat up your muscles and typically require you to rest more between each set of exercise and whole workouts.

The upside is that when you work out the same muscle groups by doing the same or similar exercises multiple times each week, you improve your overall body strength, rather than just in one area.
Circuit training, metabolic intervals, and compound lifts engage more muscle groups, skyrocket your heart rate, and burn more calories. Hitting your full body all the time from a conditioning aspect is great; it’s the model CrossFit follows.

Total-Body Workout Benefits for beginners and advanced:
1. Burn More Calories in Less Time
2. Build More Muscle
3. Increase Strength
4. Maximize Workout Efficiency
5. Have Greater Flexibility

We created workout programs with the best bodyweight exercises for burning fat at home.
When it comes to getting shredded, sometimes the best thing you can do is set down the heavy iron and go for all-out, bare-bones bodyweight exercises. Exercises that help you tone up your entire body as it works your lower body, upper body and your core.

If you want to build muscle mass, there are hundreds of different training programs you could choose from to help you achieve that goal. And although many of them will give you decent results, at least for a while, if you want to build the maximum amount of muscle in the shortest possible time, you really can’t beat a full-body workout routine.

This is especially true for those who are just starting out. So if you are a beginner in your first year or two of training, or you haven't had much in the way of results from your efforts so far, our full body workout programs can help you out.",166828,3.7272727,3,0,1,0,1,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,19,0,1,1,"Nov 18, 2018",0.75,4.03125

com.prokettlebell,Pro Kettlebell Workouts,"New, workouts uploaded weekly + hundreds of member's only workouts (click the ""explore"" tab to see all). 

Follow-along Pro Kettlebell workouts are strength & cardio in one, for minimum time and maximum rewards.  We've tracked hundreds of members through three weeks of 4-classes per week and seen undeniable success, with members often doubling the results of their rep tests in three weeks.  

Pro Kettlebell is all about using the methods and kettlebell lifting techniques discovered and honed by world-class, professional kettlebell lifters around the world to build super-hero strength without breaking you down.  The ""secret"" to all success is consistency, and you can't be consistent if you're injured, so it's critical to not over-train or do exercises that are more risky than rewarding.  

Our system for designing classes and programs evolved over years and years of running the largest kettlebell gym in the world, which required offering classes where a person brand-new to working out could be in class with a super-fit, competitive lifter standing next to them and they both get a great workout... AND the new person isn't intimidated.  It was a tough recipe to figure out, but we did! 

Only one light-to-medium kettlebell is required to complete hundreds of fun workouts on this app, the majority of which are roughly 30-minutes, but we also have shorter classes and some up to 55-minutes. 

The workouts feature a professional coach narrating the workout while you follow-along in real-time with the ""pace-setter,"" who's doing the workout with you.

If you have matching pairs and a variety of weights, don't worry, you'll get to use them!  Classes include modifiers for single or double bells, and recommendations for heavier or lighter weights when appropriate.  

We suggest everyone begin with the ""Kettlebell Kickstarter"" 4-class intro series.  You'll learn the techniques we're so passionate about while getting a great workout at the same time.

After that, you can pick and choose classes by time, theme, or body part if you like, but we always recommend follow our programs in order for best results.  Programs range from 21-days to 3 months.

Try it out, ask questions via the forum if you have any, have fun and get swinging.

To access all features and content you can subscribe to Pro Kettlebell Workouts on a monthly or yearly basis with an auto-renewing subscription right inside the app.* Pricing can vary by region and will be confirmed before purchase in the app. In app subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of their cycle.

* All payments will be paid through your Google Account and may be managed under Account Settings after the initial payment. Subscription payments will automatically renew unless deactivated at least 24-hours before the end of the current cycle. Your account will be charged for renewal at least 24-hours prior to the end of the current cycle. Any unused portion of your free trial will be forfeited upon payment. Cancellations are incurred by disabling auto-renewal.

com.samantharoobol.workoutforwomen,Workouts For Women,"You're a female and you want to get a toned body? Our workout routine will help you.
Women often start working out to tone their body, get a better butt and lose their belly fat. During this weight training for women, we will put an emphasis on these areas but also work on other important muscle groups.

This 30-day body-toning workout plan for beginners is a great routine to follow if you’re just getting started on your fitness journey!

Every woman is familiar with those tricky trouble zones that take a little extra work to tighten and tone. Our workout routines for women will work your entire body, sculpting your muscles and shredding excess fat. Having a toned body actually means that you have strong muscles with a low percentage of body fat, which provides this toning effect.

You don't need a gym membership to melt that unwanted flab and look fit. In fact, you don't even need equipment.
With minimal equipment and the convenience of home, these high-energy home workouts for women can help you get fit and lean fast. Combining cardio and strength, this full body workout burns calories fast. It can be carried out at home with no equipment. The strength exercises uses only body weight, making sure the female watchers will tone but not build their muscles.

Bodyweight exercises are realistic and functional, meaning that they help us strengthen our muscles that we use in our daily lives. Every bodyweight exercise involved utilizes multiple muscle groups, gets your heart rate pumping, and burns tons of calories. Essentially, circuit weight training, or circuit bodyweight training, burns more calories than interval training, and that in turn burns a lot more calories than steady cardio. When you strength train, you burn calories. Then, your body needs to spend hours and hours afterwards rebuilding your muscles, which in turns burns even more calories.

com.whoop.android,WHOOP,"WHOOP is your personalized digital fitness and health coach. Get the all-new WHOOP 4.0, our most advanced WHOOP yet, and pair it with your phone to unlock powerful personal insights, available directly in the WHOOP app.

WHOOP monitors your physiological data 24/7 to provide you with insights into your sleep habits, training, recovery, and overall health. It calibrates to your data over time, giving you personalized recommendations and coaching on what you can do – from when to go to bed to what behaviors to adopt – to optimize your performance and your health. This app requires a WHOOP wearable.

Here’s how it works:

Sleep: Every night, WHOOP calculates your sleep performance by measuring the sleep you got compared to the sleep your body needs. Sleep Coach lets you know when you should go to bed to optimize your performance the following day.

Strain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity – it measures how much physical and mental stress you put on yourself throughout your entire day. WHOOP considers your exercise, work, errands, travel, parenting, and more to calculate a daily Strain score ranging from 0 to 21. Strain Coach then recommends your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score to help you maximize your gains without sacrificing your Recovery.

Recovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart-rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You’ll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 0 to 100%. When you’re in the green, you’re ready for strain, when you’re in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program.

Health: Get a big-picture look at your overall health. The WHOOP 4.0 features an SPO2 sensor and skin temperature sensor to measure your blood oxygen levels and skin temperature, in addition to your heart rate, resting heart rate, and heart-rate variability. You can easily see when your health is improving, or when you might be deviating from your baseline due to stress, illness, and more. Plus, you can download your personalized health reports to send to your physician, coach, or family.

You can also use the WHOOP app to:
● Journal: Log daily behaviors like alcohol, nutrition, caffeine, meditation, stress and more to see which choices impact your performance most
● Review your performance: Weekly and monthly Performance Assessments give you a better look at how individual behaviors and choices add to or detract from your performance
● Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team’s training is going.
● Get Menstrual Cycle Coaching: Members with a natural menstrual cycle can get strain and sleep coaching recommendations to account for monthly hormonal changes
● Use WHOOP Live: Overlay real-time Recovery, Sleep, Strain or heart-rate data onto your videos
● Chat with support: Membership Services can answer any of your questions directly from the app

WHAT IS THE KETO DIET?

The keto diet (also known as a ketogenic diet, low carb diet and LCHF diet) is a low carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Maintaining a low carb diet is great for weight loss. Moreover, according to an increasing number of studies, a low carb diet helps reduce risk factors for diabetes, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, and more!

WHY REDUCE CARBS ON A KETO DIET?

We’re beginning to understand that carbs in large quantities are more harmful than previously thought, while most fats are healthy & essential (the basis of a low carb diet).

When you eat lots of carbs, your blood sugar is consistently elevated and, as a result, so is insulin. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.

This insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.

A keto diet can reverse these harmful effects & restores insulin sensitivity.

THE KETO DIET IS A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!

The nutritional landscape is changing. The keto diet (low carb diet) is growing in acceptance and a nutritional revolution is beginning. We are starting to realize the detrimental effects of our relationship with excess sugar & carbs.

The keto diet focuses on low carb recipes to keep your blood sugar stable, helping your body regain insulin sensitivity and keeping your mood & energy levels stable.

When you’re on a ketogenic diet, you can expect to:

• Lose body fat
• Have consistent energy levels during the day
• Stay satiated after meals longer, with less snacking and overeating

HUNDREDS OF LOW CARB DIET & KETO RECIPES!

Keto recipes make you feel better, live better and eat better. Each low carb recipe is delicious – we know because we only share the ones we love.

We’ve included hundreds of low carb recipes for you to choose from. The main goal of these low carb recipes is to:

• Keep carbs low – under 25g a day, ideally
• Increase your protein intake – aim for at least 60g a day
• Keep you full and satiated from delicious meals

THE BEGINNER'S KETO DIET GUIDE INCLUDES:

• What is the Keto Diet?
• Testing for Ketosis
• The Truth About Fat
• What are Macronutrients?

Get fit with our coach
Health is more than undergoing a fast and counting your calorie consumption. You need a fitness manager to assist with fasting and weight loss. Start the habit of logging your meals and snacks into the diary. By keeping up a food-tracker journal on this dieting journey, weight loss, and health gain, you can change your life. Take up easy exercise routines and meet your fitness goals with a daily workout schedule. Let us set the perfect diet for you and scan your nutrition intake with the calorie counter. If you’re looking for an app to lose weight and get healthy, we have it all!

Try intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting is an ideal fast for beginners to control weight gain. Rather than bulking up with a heavy appetite, cut carbs and set a calorific value for daily consumption. With intermittent fasting, your body will burn stored fat for energy. These burnt calories contribute to good weightloss. It is essential to label each meal with the required macros. Add more protein to your diet and keep the intermittent fast schedule simple to follow. Get the perfect fast with our app and regain health with better fitness.

Count your calories with us
It is no secret that our body’s calorie count depends on the measure of macros and nutrients in our food. Free your mind from such thoughts with our calorie counter. Use this to log your meal and count the calories. The app will set a diet for you with each macro in its proper amount, with a suitable fast like the intermittent method. By tracking your correct intake of calories with the counter, we can also suggest an exercise regime to lose them. This calorie calculator also maintains the food logger, in addition to the diary. Lose weight and shape your body the way you want!

Health trackers to scan your eating habits
A regular dose of nutrition is important in your weight-loss dieting plan. The meal coach regulates your nutrition and makes sure that the carbs, fat, and protein are kept in check. Make it a goal to create your own recipe planner. The app contains a special My Tracker feature to track your meals and health needs. My Tracker is a manager tool for many functions, such as a checker, calculator, calorie counter, etc. How you use this tracker is up to you.

<b>Accessibility Service</b>

The app features a series of alarm tasks called CAPCTHA which make sure you do not oversleep. Completing tasks like sheep counting, math equations or scanning a bar-code on your toothpaste will make sure you are fully awake and ready for your morning.

To make sure you won\'t sleep through your duties the app may use an Accessibility Service to prevent you from force stopping the app or turning off the device (cheating) before completing the alarm tasks (CAPTCHA). No private information are collected.

<b>Device Admin</b> 

This app may use the Device Administrator permission.
The reason is effective CAPTCHA (a feature to make sure you wake up in the morning) so you cannot avoid alarms by uninstalling the app during an alarm.

<b>Health disclaimer</b>

Sleep as Android is not intended for medical use, but instead to improve general fitness and well-being especially in terms of better sleep.

📍Workouts for every muscles group*  
  
  
As one of the upper body’s biggest muscle groups, your chest muscles are large enough to handle a great deal of weight. Depending on your workout intensity, you can build progressive strength and add muscle to your chest.  
  
After getting into the groove of chest workouts, you may notice that tasks that were once challenging now require less effort. From hoisting boxes and lifting pets to rearranging furniture and holding an armful of groceries, strengthened chest muscles can make these much easier to manage. As they become stronger, your chest muscles can become more efficient. The stronger your chest muscles become, the stronger your entire upper body can be.  
  
  
⭐ ⭐Benefits of chest workout ⭐ ⭐
  
The pecs are one of the largest muscles in your upper body, so they play an important role in maintaining good posture. Pecs also assist in stabilizing the shoulder joint along with your back and shoulder muscles.  
  
Better Breathing: In addition to improving your posture, strengthening and lengthening chest muscles helps to support deeper breathing. That’s because the pecs are attached to your ribs, which expand with every breath.  
  
Breast Support: Contrary to the popular belief that doing chest exercises will make breasts smaller, doing pectoral exercises will do the exact opposite. Building muscle around the breast tissue, helps to provide more lift and support.  
  
Everyday Perks: Even if you don’t realize it, you use your pecs an awful lot during daily activities. Anything that involves lifting, holding, squeezing or pushing calls on your pecs; so it doesn’t hurt to have a little extra strength in that muscle group.",2759,0,0,0,1,0,1,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,15,0,1,1,"Nov 2, 2022",1,4.5

OUR STORY
Thinco® began in 2013, out of Karen’s desperate need to help her youngest daughter Jemma aged 22 through life threatening weight related issues. This is when she understood and realised that weight related issues are more than a number that is shown on the scales.

Hence it has become a MISSION for Thinco® and a very personal passion for Karen in educating, helping and supporting others.

There is no perfect body or size and it’s about being happy and loving yourself as you are.

Karen firmly believes that there is a lack of education and support for women out there on their journeys and any weight loss should be done in a healthy environment with support to help women regain their health, happiness and confidence.

Say NO to Yo-Yo dieting! And no, popping a pill a day does not magically make the fat melt off (unfortunately). Even if it did, the effects would be short term because those bad habits would take over again.

com.eatmoreplants,EatMorePlants – Vegan Recipes,"Weekly updated with new tasty, nutritious and easy recipes that hopefully will help inspire a healthy and sustainable way of eating!

Welcome to my app! My name is Jenny, and I am the creator of the EatMorePlants app. My own journey towards a plant-based diet started some years ago. I was suffering from constant lack of energy (fatigue), as well as frequent and recurring minor illnesses. Being introduced to the whole-food, plant-based diet changed my way of living. The transition provided me with so many benefits. I felt both my energy level and health significantly improved. The idea that others may benefit of a plant-based diet the same way as I did, inspired me to develop and launch EatMorePlants.

The plant-based lifestyle has a wide variety of advantages that extend beyond you. The future of sustainable living and the future of our ecosystem will partly depend on our ability to adapt a more plant-based diet, and to do that we need great recipes at hand!

I believe balance is key. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Do the best you can, whenever you can!

RECIPES:
The app is filled with 100+ delicious vegan plant-based recipes, using easy-to-find ingredients, that will nourish your body, but never compromise on taste! I prefer to keep food simple and keep it as whole as possible. New recipes every week!

MEAL PLANS:
If you are new to the plant-based lifestyle it is crucial that you know where to find all the essential nutrients you need. In collaboration with a certified nutritionist we have created specified weekly meal plans for you to follow.

SHOPPING LIST:
To make shopping as easy as possible, every ingredient you select in a recipe can be added to an automatically generated shopping list. You can also shuffle the list to categorize all your ingredients by where they are located in the grocery store or by recipe. You can also add your own items to the shopping list, be it a toothbrush or a cactus.

APP FEATURES:
- 100+ delicious plant-based recipes.
- All recipes show calculated nutrition information.
- Filter your recipes by gluten-free, nut-free, oil-free or soy-free.
- Adjust the number of servings needed.
- Weekly meal plans developed in cooperation with certified nutritionists.
- Automatic generated shopping list for your planned meals.
- Save your favourite recipes so you easily find them next time.
- Browse tons of categories like pasta & noodles, baked & stuffed, wraps & burgers.
- No-screen sleep when you’re viewing a recipe.

SUBSCRIPTION:
The app is free for you to download and use. As a non-premium user, you will get access to shopping lists, numerous recipes & nutrition information, filtering options and more.

An ongoing subscription is required to access all app features including weekly meal plans developed in cooperation with certified nutritionists. You can choose a monthly or yearly subscription.

com.vg.notepin,notepin - Notes in notificatio,"<b>Purpose</b>

An average human checks his/her phone 80 times a day which means his/her eyes checks the notification area 80 times after beginning the day and before going to sleep.

With the help of this app added notes are shown in notification bar and are sticky which means they are not swipe-able unlike general notifications. The pinned notifications constantly reminds you of tasks that are urgent and you fear to forget.  For example filling a exam form, calling someone or wishing someone.

<b>How notepin is different from other notes and reminder apps ?</b>
Reminder apps send a notification or ring alarm to which a user mostly dismisses and in-spite of getting the reminder forgets to do the task as it gets out of the mind after a few minutes of dismissing reminder. In comparison notepin helps you pin notes or reminders as notifications so that it constantly reminds you every time you unlock your phone or swipe down the notification panel.

<b>Notes Sorting Order</b>
Notes can be sorted on the basis of- priority levels, recently added first and recently added last.

<b>Priority Levels</b>
Notes can be added with three levels, High, Medium and Low. Each note has a color associated with it which is shown as a symbol in the notification signifying the urgency of the work.",82450,4.44,49,0,1,0,1,PRODUCTIVITY,4,0,1,1,"Sep 17, 2020",0.76,4.48

<b>THE AAYU APPROACH</b>
Aayu’s yoga deals with the root of most modern chronic diseases - stress. In today’s fast-paced world, stress is a constant companion. It leads to a continuous firing of stress hormones in the body - like adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol. This puts the body at risk of manifesting chronic diseases such as Anxiety Disorders, Heart Disease, Hypertension, PCOS and others.

Aayu’s scientific yoga programs are designed to bring the body back to a state of equilibrium. Reduce the production of stress hormones and restore balance between the body's sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system response. The key is daily yoga practice on the Aayu app.
The app’s casting feature makes sure the programs are easy to follow on a big screen.

Planks are the most popular and effective fat burning exercise. They can be easily performed and activate all your muscles, including your core, shoulders, glutes, etc. Planks are the best choice for people with weak knees because they put no pressure on knees.

<b>Maximize the belly fat burning:</b> Planks are more effective than crunches at burning belly fat. Planks activate 100% of your abs, while crunches only involve 64% of them.

<b>Strengthen your core:</b> Plank workout fires up all your core muscle groups, enhances your core strength, and helps you get a strong core.

<b>Reduce back pain:</b> Plank workout can strengthen your back muscles, reduce back pain and lower the risk of back and spinal column injuries.

<b>Improve your posture & balance:</b> Plank workout requires your head, back and feet to be in a straight line. Regularly doing this will improve your balance and posture when sitting and standing.

<b>Accelerate your metabolism:</b> Doing planks keeps your metabolism high for the whole day; this dramatically boosts the fat burning process.

<b>Improve your flexibility:</b> Plank workout stretches all your posterior muscle groups, such as your shoulder blades, glutes and hamstrings, thus improving your flexibility and lowering the risk of injury.

<b>Features:</b>
- Different forms of planks provided
- Customized workout reminders help you make planking a daily workout routine

com.innodiets.joggo,Joggo,"Joggo is a running training app that helps people reach their running goals. Whether you want to: 

Cross a specific distance or pace target
Manage your weight 
Relax your mind


The Joggo app is built on 3 main pillars: Personalized Training, Education, and Motivation. Each pillar represents a set of features in our app that helps people achieve even the most ambitious goals.


Personalized training plans from beginners to pros: 
Every user is asked to fill a quiz used to determine the underlying motivation for starting to run, the risk factors one might have, and personal goals. We then ask the user to have the first free run, which we track to determine actual fitness level and running capabilities, set the starting mark, and create a personalized training plan.


Bi-weekly running plan adjustments based on progress and feedback
Even if the starting point is the same, two people will have very different progress in just two weeks. We acknowledge the differences and create a running program based on 2 weeks’ running streaks. Afterward, we re-evaluate your progress and feedback on your well-being. If you believe you can accomplish more, we then increase the intensity for the following 2 weeks’ running streaks. It is important to monitor your progress but not overdo it. 


Timely educational bits – right knowledge at the right time
Too much information could be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. The right information at the right time could be a factor that determines if you continue running or burn yourself out and quit  altogether. Our focus is to give timely bits of information right when you need it the most. As you progress, our content will progress with you to cover more advanced topics and get gradually grounded into the intricacies of running, sports, health, and nutrition.


Get rewarded for the effort and level up
We want to let you know that you are doing a great job. Despite the speed, distance, body shape, or gear – you are on the right track if you are running. Every run is rewarded with points that allow you to compare your effort with someone else and see how well you are doing. 


Have an injury? Have a question? Consult with our in-house specialists.
Sometimes we just need a bit of extra help to guide us. It is not common to have an expert runner to consult with. In case you have a question, we will match you with a top elite runner capable of giving you professional advice.",128230,4.029703,423,0,1,0,1,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,18,0,0,0,"May 14, 2021",0.52,2.48

~Prevent Muscle Imbalance: When we stretch our tight muscles, they relax and their fibers repair, protecting our muscles from muscle imbalance problems.

You can play in groups to compare and analyze your progress to determine who is the “BIGGEST LOSER”. Assigning yourself a dietbet to reach a certain defined goal every week also helps to achieve your dream body. 📅

➤ Getting slim fast is the ultimate goal of most of you. No wonder you are searching for a slimming app, and BetterTogether is the amalgamation of all essential features like fitness tips, diet plans, diet tips, and many more to reach that healthy wage. It can also serve as your step counter app to record the number of steps you walk in a day, though you can sync your favorite tracker such as google fit or fitbit also to achieve this. 📝

➤The BetterTogether app has a feature that enables you to set daily weight loss goals with your workout buddies, and you can determine who is leading the challenge effectively.

life.simple,Simple: Intermittent Fasting,"With this simple intermittent fasting app with meal tracker and water tracker features, keeping track of your eating habits and achieving weight loss results has never been easier! Learn how to fast and lose weight, get simple healthy diet tips with Simple – a meal planner and fasting tracker app with diet tracker, weight loss tracker, and food and water tracker (yes, you have to drink water in sufficient amounts!) features. Intermittent fasting is the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method and it’s trusted by hundreds of millions worldwide!

In a nutshell, Simple provides the following set of features:

-	Intetmittent fasting tracker;
-	Weight loss tracker;
-	Water tracker & drink water reminder;
-	Nutrition tracker.


What is intermittent fasting (IF) and why can it help?

IF is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans and anyone can benefit from it. You alternate eating and fasting periods and use the Simple intermittent fasting tracker app to set up your schedule. For example, you fast during a 16-hour window and can then eat during 8 hours (16:8 fasting).

IF does not tell you what food you can’t eat or to count your calories – it’s not a strict diet plan for weight loss. Instead, it simply asks that you eat zero calories during a specific period each day.

This simple fasting app is worth it. Even short fasting periods (12 hours or more that you can set in the fasting timer) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and reduce the risk of metabolic diseases. This small lifestyle change will enable you to reinstate normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating. You just have to make sure to drink water during your fasting period. And the best thing is that you have a meal planner, food tracker, and water tracker all in one place – the Simple app. The app’s water drinking reminder will be your best assistant in your fasting periods.

How do I start IF?
You don’t have to download many fasting apps or know anything about fasting. Simple will guide you and help you achieve your health goals. Simple is not just a fasting tracker. It’s an intermittent fasting app that provides you with health, weight loss, and cognitive power.

This simple fasting app prepares a program, teaches you about IF, and helps you calculate fasting time mindfully and easy.

What does Simple offer?
Simple helps you fast with:
– Daily customized tips and life hacks
– Expert advice – Smart and flexible tracking
– Easy start/end to your fasts with one quick click, set fasting reminder
– A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting
– Tips to develop a healthy eating habit
– Custom fasting protocols
– Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating

Fasting protocols in the Simple app:
– A fasting 16:8 timer (16-hour fasting, 8-hour eating), 5:2, 18:6, 20:4, 14:10
– OMAD - one meal a day
– Circadian Rhythm Fasting

com.opentechiz.heavybagpro,Boxing Training & Workout App,"<h2>Heavy Bag Pro is a  must-have app for punching bag or shadowboxing training, whether you're an experienced fighter or just getting started with martial arts!</h2>
🥊 <b>Level up</b> – Learn 100s of new kickboxing, classic boxing, and Muay Thai combos
🥊 <b>Easy to use</b> – Start the boxing timer and train for up to 16 rounds
🥊 <b>Never run out of ideas</b> – Choose from technique, drills, HIIT and partner punching bag workouts
🥊 <b>Gym-like experience at home</b> – Our users say that using the app feels like being in a real boxing class with a dedicated boxing trainer

<i>""It is nice to have an app that really teaches as you go. I am really out of shape and just getting back in to boxing/kick boxing. Glad I found this app.""</i> Lisa Zaroff. 

<h2>Train-along kickboxing, Muay Thai and boxing workouts</h2>
This punching bag training app is guiding you with your Muay Thai, kick boxing, and boxing workouts. It’s like your own fighting trainer who instructs your heavy bag workout. You’ll never be demotivated or run out of ideas again!

All the workouts are carefully designed by absolute professionals, nothing is left to chance. You can be sure that after completing a training you will be tired, but happy, having learned something new. 

The app is suitable for fighters of any combat sport who want to advance their skills and burn 1000s of calories. Workouts are categorized into <b>classic boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, and K1</b>. They are also suitable for practitioners of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), Jiu-Jitsu, Karate, Taekwondo, or any other type of martial arts.
While it would be good to know the basics of boxing to get the maximum out of the application, there are a lot of total beginners who use the app continuously, just because boxing workouts are pure fun and amazing calorie-burners for all levels of fight sports enthusiasts. This is not specifically a ""learn boxing"" app, but it surely helps you to learn a lot of boxing combinations. And it is easy to train along with the voice instructions and animations explaining the techniques.

<h2>Punch bag or shadow boxing</h2> While a heavy bag or a sand bag is helpful, it’s not absolutely necessary to be able to train hard with the app. You can use the app to do shadow boxing at home, so you already know the combos you want to master on a boxing bag or during sparring when you hit the gym.
<u>Tip</u>: For sweaty, challenging kickboxing training and great cardio, try shadowboxing with weights in your hands!

<h2>Features of Heavy Bag Pro include:</h2> <b>🔥 70+ guided, ready-to-go workouts</b> – just start the round timer and train
<b>🔥 Warm-ups, cool-downs, and conditioning</b> – diverse training from the beginning to the end
<b>🔥 Custom workouts</b> – create workouts from any combo or technique you want to focus on
<b>🔥 Learning corner</b> – master single punches or kicks and combos to add to your arsenal
<b>🔥 Boxing timer</b> – keep up the intensity while training on your own without a boxing trainer or guidance.

<u>New workouts and combos are added constantly, so you’ll never get bored.</u>

<b>Is the app free?</b>
There are two versions: free and premium. With the free version, you get three full workouts (one in each martial arts discipline - boxing, kickboxing, and Thai boxing) and an interval round timer (without ads). If you want to unlock all the workouts and other features and exercises, you’ll need to upgrade to premium. Monthly subscription costs less than a one-time visit to most gyms. A year's cost is less than one hour of private boxing training. 

<h2>Best Punching Bag Workouts Out There!</h2> If you’re serious about getting a leg up on your competition, or just want to improve your self defense skills, you need this boxing app. Not only does it up your motivation with fun, guided punching bag home workouts, but it helps you master the combos that will outsmart your competition.

splits.splitstraining.dothesplits.splitsin30days,Splits Training in 30 Days,"Splits Training is designed for all levels to <b>get full splits</b> step by step, even if you are a beginner. The mixing of static and dynamic splits helps you <b>improve flexibility</b> effectively and achieve results faster than you think. With about <b>10 min a day</b>, you’ll get closer and closer to the floor!

Productive stretches for splits in 30 days are suitable for men and women, adults and kids. You can customize your splits training based on your own preferences, <b>no equipment</b> needed.

Whether you want to do a full split for dance, ballet, gymnastics or martial arts, this training will help you get there.

<b>Why splits</b>?
Splits have been proven to prevent injuries, increase muscle strength, relieve muscle stiffness and give you better circulation.

<b>Improve your flexibility & balance</b>
Flexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.

<b>Loosen your hip flexors</b>
Due to sitting at a desk all day, most people have extremely tight hip flexors, which can cause pain, especially in your lower back. Splits open up these areas to relieve your muscle tension.

<b>Deeply stretch your legs</b>
When doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time. Doctors will recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.

<b>Boost your circulation</b>
Splits lengthen your muscles and improve your circulation by increasing blood flow to your muscles.

Please get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits. Splits need time; your muscles need time to stretch, recover and adapt to the new demands. Be patient, and stick to it; you’ll soon see progress.

<b>Features</b>
- Splits for all levels, splits for beginners, splits for men, splits for women, splits for kids
- Step-by-step directions on how to do the splits for all levels
- Effective formula to help achieve results fast
- Splits in 30 days
- Customize your own training plan
- Easy-to-follow instruction, animation and video guide
- Record your progress automatically
- Stretches for splits target all muscles you need to become super flexible

IS IT EFFECTIVE?

It’s proven that intermittent fasting leads to fast weight loss. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's ""fat-burning"" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.

IS IT SAFE?

Yes. It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.

For each theme, you will find a practical part with exercises organized into two main categories: without a ball and with a ball.
⇒ Our descriptions will be voluntarily with few “ details and specifications” because we consider that several factors will influence the parameters of the exercises ( the training day, in what cycle the session is to be found, the level of the players, their fitness level, their age-classification,...).
⇒ We have chosen to explain how to apply our sessions in the theoretical part so that you can adapt the parameters of the exercises to your convenience (size of the field, number of players, duration of the exercise, number of repetitions and sets, duration and nature of recovery).

com.windhund.clients.blackroll,BLACKROLL® Fascia Training,"💪  Do you want to improve your daily training, posture, flexibility & physical performance?
🧘‍♂️  Are you looking for relaxation exercises for your muscles or against your back pain, neck pain, knees pain or shoulders pain?
🎯 Here you will find versatile & highly efficient exercises for your daily full body workout at home: fascial training, self-massage, stretching, regeneration & functional training with BLACKROLL® products - all free of charge.
😍 Now you can create a BLACKROLL® account to benefit even further!

<b>Why fascia training?</b>
The rolling & stretching of the muscles improves the flexibility of your body. The fascia structure is preserved, resulting in better mobility, posture & muscle strength. Fascia training also ensures less pain & higher physical performance. Exercises with fascia rolls relax your body.  You will find over 190 exercises for back training, stretching exercises, relaxation exercises for neck & shoulders.

<b>Quick facts about fascia</b>
Fascia connects all connective tissues (i.e. muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments & blood) & holds the whole body together. There are four different types of fascia (structural, intersectoral, visceral & spinal), but they are all connected. When fascia is healthy, it is flexible & pliable and your entire body and health can benefit from that. 

<b>Advantages of fascia training</b>
improved blood circulation
faster recovery during sports activities
reduced risk of injury
less everyday pain
improved sporting performance
increased mobility


<b>Avoid injuries</b>
The right exercises before & after training can play an important role in your training routine. Rolling out before exercise prepares the body for greater effort & improves training results. The risk of injury is reduced & cramps are prevented. 
After training, stretching & cool down rolling relaxes your muscles & improves your fasci structure. This in turn reduces sore muscles.
Alleviate pain
Fasciae support your body structures including the spine. For this reason, the use of fascia rolls is recommended for many types of pain such as back pain or neck pain. Research shows that stretching exercises improve blood circulation in muscles & joints, which can help to heal & relieve pain. 
In the BLACKROLL® App you will find exercises for the cervical spine, back exercises or scoliosis exercises. You will also find easy to understand herniated disc exercises or exercises for the cervical & lumbar spine.
Stretching of the upper body at: chest & thorax pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, impingement syndrome, thoracic spine syndrome (BWS),
Stretching of the lower body: back pain, runner's knee, knee pain, lumbago, hip pain, calf pain: loosen hardened calves, heel pain,
Whole body stretching: slipped disc, scoliosis

<b>Daily routines by sport discipline</b> 
Warm-up exercises in the morning
Stretching exercises 
Workouts to warm up & cool down for various sports like running or golf, and much more.

com.appeaseinc.todolist135,Todo List: 135 Daily Task List,"<b>Why manage tasks with our productivity app?</b>

You can plan your daily tasks and organize by priority with our list maker. Planning your day using the 1-3-5 todo list strategy will keep you focused and increase your productivity by helping you accomplish all the tasks in your todo list and meet any deadline.

With the 1-3-5 todo list strategy, you'll never need to look for another daily checklist again!

<b>1-3-5 Todo List Explained</b>

Your average task list has 2 fatal flaws that affect productivity:

1. The number of tasks in the daily todo list is unlimited.
2. All tasks within the tasklist have the same effort and priority.

These flaws allow people to create a long and impossible todo list without priority or size estimates for the daily tasks. Our drag drop list is different: we use a strategy to maximize your productivity.

The 1-3-5 rule helps you focus on what's important and set realistic expectations about what you can accomplish in a day. This is achieved by limiting your daily tasks to 9 tasks with fixed sizes: 1 big task, 3 medium tasks, and 5 small tasks.

This can be difficult at first because most people are not accustomed to sizing and limiting their daily tasks. With practice though, this strategy can help you accomplish the things you put on your daily checklist, rather than what happened to get done, and you can set yourself up for productivity and success by completing your checklist every single day.

<b>Key Features of our list maker:</b>
With the current version of our tasklist app, you can:
• create daily checklists for yesterday, today, and tomorrow
• calendar view to add tasks to any date and plan your week
• calendar indicators to show you which days have complete or incomplete tasks
• save tasks automatically as you make changes (all task list data is stored locally on phone)
• copy tasks from one task list to another task list
• move tasks from one task list to another task list
• every daily todo list is a drag drop list for easy organization and prioritization
• clear items in a task list
• view the built-in info page to read about the core concept (1-3-5 todo list rule) and get tips to optimize your daily checklist
• easily mark tasks on your daily todo list as complete with the tap of a checkbox
• track future tasks or save tasks for later using the someday list
• use the settings page to easily switch between light theme and dark theme
• use the settings to enable automatic task carry over
• calendar view to add tasks to any date
• widget to quickly and easily see your daily todo list for today
• data backups for your task list so you never have to worry about losing data

<b>Future Features of our list maker:</b>
We plan to add more features to our tasklist app, including:
• someday list improvements and configuration
• interactive copy/move for overwriting tasks
• an analysis page to show you how you're doing with your daily checklists

<b>Why use a list maker for daily tasks at all?</b>
• increase the likelihood of completing tasks (the everyday todo that is written down is more likely to get done)
• reduce stress by not keeping everything in your head
• make it easier to visualize your daily todo list with our simple UI
• sort by priority using the drag drop list

<b>Feedback for our list maker</b>

Get fit – playing games!

Plankpad combines a fitness device with games and workouts on your Android device.
By playing games, your focus is more into the game than on counting every second.
This makes your plank exercise much longer, reaching your goals faster while the time flies by having fun.

To start an exercise, you just need to download the app, place your device on the straight aligned Plankpad to synchronize and choose a game or a workout. The app also teaches you to do the perfect plank.

To play a game you have to balance the Plankpad left and right. The app and the gyroscope of your mobile device are in perfect sync with the Plankpad. There is a game for everyone like, Candy Monster, Pong Soccer, Duck Shoot, Meteor Madness, Wave Rider, and Snow Cruisin`. And in the future, there will be even more. 

The games will challenge you to collect more and more points and you will forget about the time, so your workout will last much longer. 

Besides the games there is the workout section. The Plankpad has to stay straight, while you are following the plank exercises. 

Since the Plankpad can also be used as a Balance Board to train the motor coordination, improve reaction time and to prevent injuries, we created two games specially for balancing. The balance board turns into a surf or snow board and you play fun games while working your lower muscles out and increasing your body balance and stability.

Now the game is up to you!

Cycling is an excellent workout that engages your whole body. Much like a run, workouts like cycling and biking make the best of your energy and health. You can plan a daily route map, set your navigation and time, and take your bike for a free spin!

Start slow with a distance tracker
Begin your cycling exercise with your goals set for covering a short distance at low speed. For beginners, we suggest cycling your bike at a lesser speed and gradually increasing your pace over time. Make a well-planned ride with our GPS features, and make use of our distance tracker to manage your miles covered. Riding your bike is an exercise that activates and tones your leg muscles, but it is essential to ensure a steady plan that does not tire your body. Pick up your cycling speed with a weekly hike and keep up your passion for the ride.

Maintain your training and time
Use our free planner to map your route, track your distance, and provide GPS navigation. It is vital to take an interval between cycling sessions. This cycling regime will help you finalize a rigid training schedule that you can easily maintain. Our planner promptly informs and updates your training plan to match your weight loss and fitness goals. Set a timer for your daily goals and listen to audio music to make the workout more leisurely.

Running workout and body training
Our app offers running workouts as well as other interval training routines as well. Running is an exercise that boosts your strength as much as cycling. The number of calories burned is almost the same in both types of workouts. With our distance tracker and GPS features at your disposal, you can join our tribe of dedicated runners to enhance your fitness and attain healthy weight loss. 

App features to help you grow
Check out free features like GPS navigation in our app to assist your cycling plans. The distance tracker helps you keep track of your bike ride or run, while the planner successfully sets your route and time. Our coaching lessons strive to bring out the best in you. Our biking app offers accurate navigation tools to oversee your exercise, so cycle and ride easily with adequate GPS facilities. Keep your speed in check with our speedometer. Have a look at your workouts stats on your computer at home and share them with your friends.
